# Perl motivation survey - data, processing scripts and results

See <http://blogs.perl.org/users/vyacheslav_matjukhin/2012/11/open-source-motivation-survey.html> for the original announcement of this survey.

# Contents

This repo will include:
* anonymized results
* scripts for processing these results
* html/pdf with histograms and other aggregated data

# Data

The raw, anonymized data can be found here: <http://berekuk.wufoo.eu/reports/perl-motivation-raw-data/>. Use the "export" button to get the tab-separated data for further processing.

I'm going to import it into this repo when the survey will be over, in case my wufoo account won't last.

# Scripts

`process.pl` fetches the survey data and processes it.

By now, it prints the aggregated results to the terminal.

# HTML/PDF

TBD. I hope `process.pl` will generate them.
